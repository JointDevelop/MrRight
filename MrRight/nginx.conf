# About Events model:
events {

    worker_connections  10240;  # Maximum number of connections per worker process

# About Protocal:
http {
    # Basic default settings. (We do not need to change, just use default settings like this.)
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    # Log Format: The main log for Nginx called main.
    log_format main '$time_local $remote_addr $status $request_time '
                    '$request [$body_bytes_sent/$bytes_sent] '

    # Path of global Request Log and Error Log. The Path is point to global document, it not need to be in MrRight Projects.
    access_log /var/logs/nginx/access.log main; # Use "log_format main" that we have already defined above.
    error_log  /var/logs/nginx/error.log  warn; # Use warn format that Nginx system default define.

    # About Connections:
    sendfile            on;  # sendfile and tcp_nopush must be the same, usually set them on.
    tcp_nopush          on;
    keepalive_timeout   65;  # connection will keep alive 65s to avoid buil-connect-close frequently.
    gzip                on;  # Gzip to pack the Response package.

    # About Payload Balance:
    upstream app_server {
        server 127.0.0.1:9000       weight=3;

    # For Example: Worker Server needed to change (redirect) entrance of this Web site.
